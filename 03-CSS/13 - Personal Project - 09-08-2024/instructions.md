# SCSS-Based Website Project

## Objective
Develop a responsive website that closely matches the provided Figma designs, utilizing SCSS for styling and incorporating animations. The project will consist of at least two pages and follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.

## Key Features
1. SCSS Implementation
2. BEM Methodology
3. Animations
4. Responsive Design
5. Multiple Pages

## Technical Specifications

### 1. SCSS Implementation
- Utilize SCSS for all styling
- Leverage SCSS features such as variables, mixins, and nesting
- Organize SCSS files into a logical structure (e.g., separate files for layout, components, variables)

### 2. BEM Methodology
- Implement BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention
- Use the Block_Element--modifier pattern, but limit nesting to a single level
- Avoid excessive nesting beyond Block_Element--modifier
- Ensure consistent and meaningful class names

use box__info... don't use box__info__title (don't use more than 2 levels of nesting) box__info h3
You can use box__info--highlighted (use modifier for the block)



### 3. Animations
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user experience
- Use CSS transitions and keyframe animations where appropriate
- Ensure animations are performant and don't hinder usability

### 4. Responsive Design
- Develop a mobile-first approach
- Implement responsive breakpoints for various device sizes
- Ensure layout and functionality adapt seamlessly across devices

### 5. Multiple Pages
- Create at least two distinct pages
- Maintain consistent styling and navigation between pages
- Implement shared components and layouts across pages

### 6. Clean Code Practices
- Write semantic HTML5
- Follow SCSS/CSS best practices for maintainability
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper indentation and formatting
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code sections

### 7. Figma Design Fidelity
- Closely match visual design elements from Figma files
- Implement accurate typography, colors, and spacing
- Recreate any custom UI components as closely as possible

### 8. Version Control
- Use personal git repository for project management
- Use Git for version control
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Organize work into logical branches if necessary

### 9. Performance Optimization
- Minimize use of large assets
- Optimize images for web
- Ensure efficient CSS selectors and rules

### 10. Accessibility
- Implement proper ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation functionality
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
