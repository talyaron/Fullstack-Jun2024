# TypeScript If Statements Exercises for Beginners and Intermediate Students



## More Challenging Exercises

### Exercise 5: Leap Year Checker

Write a program that asks the user to enter a year, then tells them if it's a leap year or not. A leap year is divisible by 4, except for century years (years ending with 00). The century years are leap years only if they are perfectly divisible by 400.

### Exercise 6: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Ask the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, then have the computer randomly choose. Compare the choices and determine the winner using if statements.

### Exercise 7: Simple Calculator

    Make a calculator that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /). Use if statements to perform the correct operation and display the result. Remember to handle division by zero!

### Exercise 8: Password Strength Checker

Write a program that checks the strength of a password. Ask the user to enter a password, then use if statements to check:
- If it's at least 8 characters long and no more than 20 characters long.


Tell the user if their password is "OK", "Too short", or "Too long" based on the length of the password.

### Exercise 9: Temperature Converter with Recommendations

Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Ask the user to enter a temperature and the unit (F or C). Convert it to the other unit and display the result. Additionally, use if statements to give clothing recommendations based on the temperature:
- Below 32°F (0°C): "It's freezing! Wear a heavy coat."
- 32°F to 50°F (0°C to 10°C): "It's cold. Bring a jacket."
- 51°F to 68°F (11°C to 20°C): "It's cool. A light sweater should be fine."
- 69°F to 86°F (21°C to 30°C): "It's warm. T-shirt weather!"
- Above 86°F (30°C): "It's hot! Stay cool and hydrated."

These exercises will help you practice using if statements in more complex scenarios, combining them with other programming concepts. Remember to break down the problems into smaller steps and use proper indentation in your code!
