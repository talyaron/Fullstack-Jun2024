// ### Exercise 4: Leap Year Checker
// Write a program that asks the user to enter a year, then tells them if it's a leap year or not.
//  A leap year is divisible by 4, except for century years (years ending with 00). 
// The century years are leap years only if they are perfectly divisible by 400.
