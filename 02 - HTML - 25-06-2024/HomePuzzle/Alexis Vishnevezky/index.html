 <h3> 
    I'm 24, born in Israel, but also raised in Ukraine. Engaged and a Mom to a beautiful kitten named Skaii(still haven't decided if he is Sky or Skaii)</p>
 
    Studied robotics and programming since I was 10 and liked it so much I even started my B.S in Computer Science. </p>
</h3><p>Luckily I realized the university I was studying in wasn't the one to teach me, but to traumatise me hehe</p>
  <p>So I changed my degree to Economics and Management and started from the beginning this time at the Open University </p>
 <p>Throughout the time I studied I've decided to take more courses(because, I guess I was bored:) so thanks to these courses I am now an accountant, who enjoys robotics and programming and is ready to beat the trauma!</p>
   <p> Oh, and here is a picture of me, that is on my student id for almost 3 years that I made wearing my pajamas</p>
