    <h1>hello everyone &#x2764</h1>

    <br>
    <p>My name is Noor Taweel, and im from isifya. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Education, but after careful consideration, I’ve decided not to pursue a career directly related to my field of study. Instead, I’m diving into the exciting world of Full Stack Development with the goal of working in the tech industry.</p>    <br>

    <p>One of my hobbies is capturing landscape photos and focusing on small details from every place I visit. Whether it’s a breathtaking view or a tiny hidden gem, I love preserving those moments through my lens.</p>

    <p>I’m also passionate about design! I enjoy creating visually appealing content, especially for Instagram business accounts and bloggers. Whether it’s crafting eye-catching posts or designing wedding invitations and brochures, I find immense joy in expressing creativity through visual elements.</p>

    <p>Despite having no prior background in the field, I’m excited to learn Full Stack development. I’m diving in headfirst, eager to acquire new skills and contribute to exciting projects. My lack of experience won’t hold me back—I’m determined to invest time, effort, and dedication to succeed in this dynamic industry.</p>
