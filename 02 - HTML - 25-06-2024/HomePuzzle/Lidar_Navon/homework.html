            <h2>Welcome to My Website :)</h2>
            <p>This is a short introduction about myself.</p>
            <p>My name is Lidar and I go by the nickname Li, I am an <strong>aspiring content creator</strong> that loves to play video games and make friends, I also do a little bit of <em>editing</em> on the side</p>
            <p>For a long time now I wanted to be a youtuber or a twitch streamer which is basically just a person who goes around, turning on his camera and speaking to hundreds.. or even thousands of people!
            but at the age of 19, 2 months ago, I put a lot of work and motivation into a brand new youtube channel I have made called <strong>MilkifiedDreams</strong> since making it
        lots of people discovered who I am and are loving the content I make! I even get a lot of random fan arts and it brings a lot of joy into my heart, heres an example!</p>
            </p>

        <p>If you dont know what <strong>"Fanart"</strong> Is, its basically when you recieve drawings from people who like you or the content you make, they show their love and support throughout drawing your character</p>
        </section>
        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>When it comes to my personal life, I edit videos and work in a retail store,
       I also worked at roladin's bakery for around an year, thats pretty much it :)
        </p>
        <p>Other than that, I dont have much to say, I hope you enjoyed looking at my site and have a wonderful day ahead of you!</p>
