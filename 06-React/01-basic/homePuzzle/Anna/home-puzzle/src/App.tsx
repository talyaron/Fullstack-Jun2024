    post : 'Louis Cartier created the Tank watch in 1917. A legend was born. The first prototype was presented as a gift to General Pershing some years before the watch was introduced into the market in 1919. The lugs blend seamlessly into the bare edges of the flat vertical brancards, giving the watch its unique aesthetic. The clean, crisp lines have proved hugely popular with a free-spirited, elegant client√®le. The now-iconic Tank watch has inspired countless variations, yet managed to preserve its distinctive identity.' ,
